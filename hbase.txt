Forward dedupe chain
F0 -> F1 -> F2
Full bits on the latest version. Earlier versions referring to it for unchanged bits
Fast access on last version; quick deletion on old versions
Backup better on compressions and less bits uploads

Logical hot, warm, cold categories
Layered compaction. Integrate with data compacting layers, using date-tier algo than size-tier, to output:
- A secondary field in rowkey, timestamp for faster query (like an alpha-beta cut to focus on warm hdfs file search),
- Storage media selection (ram, ssd, hdd)
Lazy seek
Prefix bloom filter. A standard technique to use a top-row KV in hfile to determine a hit, so to avoid whole file seek on non-hit hfiles.
Secondary field range. Extend by building another top-row KV on secondary key field, so to reduce false-positves on bloom filter searches resulting in multiple hfile search.
